# Phone Plans of Telecom Company

## 1. Description
Tariffs imposed must cover the cost of providing the service to the consumer. If a telecom operator cannot recover its costs, it will make a loss and the company will go bankrupt. Tariffs are also used to cover maintenance, additional research and other indirect costs associated with providing the service. However, telecom service providers are careful not to over-price each service, as prices have a direct influence on demand for that service (supply and demand). Such an operator constantly balances the need to provide cheaper rates, especially if there is strong competition, with the cost of maintaining the service at an optimum quality that is acceptable to the customer. If an operator charges too much, it risks alienating its customers, resulting in a loss of traffic and therefore revenue; if they charge too little, they will have insufficient capital to maintain the network's quality of service. Over time this might result in customer attrition.

## 4. Results
Revenue from the 'ultra' tariff is almost 2 times higher than the 'smart' tariff. The main source for 'ultra' tariff is subscription fees, while the benefits from 'smart' tariff are evenly distributed between payment for services and the subscription fee. As a result, future trend is to get rid of text messages and focus on Internet services.
